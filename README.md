# Insurance Risk Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and risk segmentation
for health insurance customers using demographic and lifestyle attributes.

The goal is to identify risk patterns that are valuable for:
- Insurance pricing strategy
- Risk mitigation
- Feature engineering for machine learning models

## Dataset
Public health insurance dataset containing:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Smoking status
- Region
- Medical charges

## Key Analysis
- Risk segmentation using medical charges (Low, Medium, High)
- BMI categorization (Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- Composite risk profiling (Smoker + BMI interaction)
- Business-oriented data visualization

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
